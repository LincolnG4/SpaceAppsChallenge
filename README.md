## MODULAIR PURIFYING SYSTEM - THE BEST SOLUTION FOR YOU. EVERYWHERE.

Differently from regular purifying systems, the team seeks cost reduction by using more economic assembly material with an efficient filtration mechanism, which takes into consideration the difficulties at eliminating virus and bacteria from indoor air. The solution proposed consists in an Air Purifier using UV-C Technology integrated with HEPA filtering process.When facing a challenge of this magnitude, the possibility of providing helping methods to the community is extremely important, as the solution is able to impact a wide range of the population.

Merging a conventional filtration mechanism with UV-C radiation technology, based on Nasa’s own Airocide product, enables our solution to provide a better air quality at indoor ambients at lower costs, making a positive impact in the lives of individuals in vulnerable conditions. The project puts together two technologies in a cheaper and more accessible structure, making its validation faster and simpler. Even though all the components exist already, the innovation comes in the way they are utilized and in the development of new support structures, adapting the product for different environments.

The operation principal is simple: A compressor pulls air inside of the chamber. This air is initally filtered through a fisical filter. After that, this air will be displaced based in a flap mechanism, going to one of the two chamber. Inside the chamber, an UV-C Light is responsible for filtering Virus and Bacteria for 15 seconds, seeking a complete filtering. Once the filtering time ends, the chamber a flap allows the air to go back to the ambient, but, simultaneously, the other chambers restarts the filtering process with dirty air. 

### Problem
High Levels of pollution in large urban centers are not new information. NASA’s Air Quality Group has been collecting data showing how NO2 concentration decreased recently and this changes are driven by alteration in human behavior as a response to evolving restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.


This drastic measures such as lockdown taken by countries worldwide to contain the spread of COVID-19 have influenced air pollution dynamics substantially, at a planetary scale. The most effective prevention tool implemented in many countries is home isolation for both healthy and infected individuals with mild symptoms. Isolation for protection from COVID-19 might be effective, but unfortunately, isolation with improper ventilation could lead to other health problems,such as irritation, physical symptoms, respiratory and heart diseases, and cancer.

People stay indoors for about 93% of their time and this may increase to 100% for some in the current situation, which increases their rate of exposure to poor Indoor Air Quality. Indoor concentration of some contaminants are sometimes 2-5 times their relative outdoor concentration. Home isolation due to coronavirus might protect us from this virus, but poor ventilation due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 might lead to other health problems. An air purifier can be a good outlet for this issue, but most of the population does not have enough budget to afford such a device due to high level prices. Furthermore, most of this equipment is not adaptable to the environment, requiring a room redesign to have a full efficiency at purifying the air. 

### SOLUTION
Merging a conventional filtration mechanism with UV-C radiation technology, based on Nasa’s own Airocide product, enables our solution to provide a better air quality at indoor ambients at lower costs, making a positive impact in the lives of individuals in vulnerable conditions. The project puts together two technologies in a cheaper and more accessible structure, making its validation faster and simpler.

### PROJECT DEVELOPMENT 

Coming from a different background of usual Hackathon teams, ours consists mainly of mechanical and electrical engineers, so, the choice of challenge was purifying air, which enables us to build a prototype instead of creating an app. 
The main focus of the solution is to help the society to live better through the improvement of air quality, both during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. After discarding outdated options, inspired by Nasa's purifying technologies, ModulAir was the chosen concept based on its viability and the potential to make a positive impact on people’s lives. 
The availability of numerous articles about air purifying, both on space and on Earth, was essential to provide a better comprehension about the different processes. Based on the provided articles and data about air quality the team was able to elaborate and later improve our solution constantly.
To develop a prototype during this digital Hackathon, while not being able to physically interact with the other team members, the softwares of choice were SolidWorks and Tinkercad, the first to emulate a 3D product and the second to validate the Arduino control system.

Features
--------

1. **Selective contrast**

    On a sunny summer day I love to read a book outside. Not right in the sun;
    that's too bright. I'll hunt for a shady spot under a tree. The shaded
    paper contrasts with the crisp text nicely. If you were to actually measure
    the contrast between the two, you'd find it is much lower than black text
    on a white background (or white on black) on your display device of choice.
    Black text on white from a computer display is akin to reading a book in
    direct sunlight and tires the eye.

    ![solarized selective contrast](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-selcon.png)

    Solarized reduces *brightness contrast* but, unlike many low contrast
    colorschemes, retains *contrasting hues* (based on colorwheel relations)
    for syntax highlighting readability.

2. **Both sides of the force**

    ![solarized dualmode](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-dualmode.png)

    I often switch between dark and light modes when editing text and code.
    Solarized retains the same selective contrast relationships and overall
    feel when switching between the light and dark background modes. A *lot* of
    thought, planning and testing has gone into making both modes feel like
    part of a unified colorscheme.

3. **16/5 palette modes**

    ![solarized palettes](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-165.png)

    Solarized works as a sixteen color palette for compatibility with common
    terminal based applications / emulators. In addition, it has been carefully
    designed to scale down to a variety of five color palettes (four base
    monotones plus one accent color) for use in design work such as web design.
    In every case it retains a strong personality but doesn't overwhelm.

5.  **Precision, symmetry**

    ![solarized symmetry](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-sym.png)

    The monotones have symmetric CIELAB lightness differences, so switching
    from dark to light mode retains the same perceived contrast in brightness
    between each value. Each mode is equally readable. The accent colors are
    based off specific colorwheel relations and subsequently translated to
    CIELAB to ensure perceptual uniformity in terms of lightness. The hues
    themselves, as with the monotone \*a\*b values, have been adjusted within
    a small range to achieve the most pleasing combination of colors.

    See also the [Usage & Development](#usage-development) section below for
    details on the specific values to be used in different contexts.

    This makes colorscheme inversion trivial. Here, for instance, is a sass
    (scss) snippet that inverts solarized based on the class of the html tag
    (e.g. `<html class="dark red">` to give a dark background with red accent):

        $base03:    #002b36;
        $base02:    #073642;

            a, a:active, a:visited { color: $rebase1; }
        }
        @mixin accentize($accent) {
            a, a:active, a:visited, code.url { color: $accent; }
            h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {color:$accent}
        }
        /* light is default mode, so pair with general html definition */
        html, .light { @include rebase($base3,$base2,$base1,$base0,$base00,$base01,$base02,$base03)}
        .dark  { @include rebase($base03,$base02,$base01,$base00,$base0,$base1,$base2,$base3)}
        html * {
            color-profile: sRGB;

Usage & Development
-------------------

If you are considering developing a port for Solarized, please see also the
[developer notes](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/DEVELOPERS) for
information about optional repository structure and readme formats.

Solarized flips between light and dark modes. In each mode, four monotones form
the core values (with an optional fifth for emphasized content).

![value samples - dark](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-values-dark.png)

![value samples - light](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/raw/master/img/solarized-values-light.png)

Thus in the case of a dark background colorscheme, the normal relationship for
background and body text is `base03:base0` (please note that body text is
**not** `base00`).  Note also that in cases where the background and foreground
can be specified as a pair value, text can be highlighted using a combination
of `base02:base1`. The L\*a\*b lightness difference between `base03:base0` and
`base02:base1` is identical by design, resulting in identical readability
against both normal and highlighted backgrounds. An example use case is folded
text in Vim which uses `base02` for the background and `base1` for the
foreground.

The values in this example are simply inverted in the case of a light
background.
